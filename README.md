# Realtime-Traffic-Sign-Recognition
# Traffic Sign Recognition Model
## Objective
This project aims to build a model capable of quickly recognizing the 40 most common road signs for a self-driving car competition. The project focuses on understanding how to construct a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the TensorFlow framework and a machine vision processing method.
## Approach
1. **Data Collection:** Gather a comprehensive dataset of road signs, focusing on the 40 most common types.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean, augment, and preprocess the dataset to improve the model's performance.
3. **Model Architecture:** Design and implement a CNN architecture using TensorFlow for training and inference.
4. **Training:** Train the model using the preprocessed dataset to learn the features of the road signs.
5. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics to ensure its effectiveness.
6. **Deployment:** Deploy the trained model to be used in real-time traffic sign recognition systems.
## Project Components
Traffic_Sign_Detection.py: This component is responsible for training the model and saving it for recognition purposes.

RealTime_Test.py: This component is responsible for real-time testing using a webcam.
## Results
The project aims to achieve high accuracy and speed in recognizing the 40 most common road signs, which are crucial for self-driving cars to navigate safely and efficiently. The project has achieved a high accuracy of around 90% in recognizing road signs, even when using a blurry camera. This demonstrates the model's robustness and effectiveness in real-world scenarios.
